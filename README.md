# My CS150 final project

A word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words by guessing letters.

There are three categories of words. Type a letter and hit enter to make a guess.
If your guess is correct, the corresponding letter(s) will be revealed in the word.
If your guess is incorrect, you have 5 attempts to guess the word correctly.       
All words are single words.
The game ends when you correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.
